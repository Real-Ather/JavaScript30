    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array? now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    // They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = players.slice();


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heee hawww';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const cap3 = {...person};

    /* Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it. */
